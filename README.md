# School Timetabler

A website that can be used by students to pick subjects and sort them into a timetable information including teacher and classroom.
The website uses a standard that many schools use where there are certain amount of periods a day (The amount of periods in a day can be changed). Each period for every day of the week is assigned to a block which is represented by a letter (The amount of blocks can be changed). Classes, teachers, rooms and students are assigned to a block. No place or person can be assigned to the same block twice. The website also checks if there are too many students assigned to a classroom.
